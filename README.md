bongo cat reads your inputs even when unfocused! This is meant for people who want to display what buttons they're pressing while playing a (>= 2 button) game. The background is green to aid in chromakeying.

# Setup
bongo cat needs two installs to work properly: `pygame` and `keyboard`.

```
pip install pygame
pip install keyboard
```

# Run
cd to the main folder with main.py and run it:
```
python main.py
```
`f` and `j` controls the lil guy's pawsies.

# Config
you'll have to edit the actual files, but you can change a couple things such as:
* the background color (defaults to 0, 255, 0)
* which buttons correspond to each paw (defaults to `f` and `j`)
* the bongo cat themself!? (as long as the image dimensions are the same the program will work so replace with whatever image you like)
